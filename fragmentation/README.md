# Fragmentation scripts
Scripts to cut compounds into elementary fragments. See Section S1 of our manuscript for more details. Note that the scripts are only part of our fragmentation scheme and they are used as a demonstration of our procedure to cut elementary fragments. They do not represent the entire workflow of our fragmentation scheme.

## Usage

```
python cut_compound.py
